## A Slight Disclaimer
Any content you may see here, according to Reddit's standards, is NOT rated as offensive or safe only for those over the age of 18. That is to say that all content shown in this clone (Reddthat) has been designated by Reddit itself or moderators to be safe for anyone under 18. However, this does not guarantee you won't see any offensive content (As 'offensive' is ultimately subjective to the person). Posts are user-generated and moderated, but depending on WHO moderates content for WHICH subreddits, you may see language or phrases that offend you in some way. Reddit is Reddit.

Opening the live production version of Reddthat will prompt you with a similar warning as above. I do not take responsibility for the content you may see.
